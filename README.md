Gathering machine learning data

Gathering data is one of the most important stages of machine learning workflows. During data collection, you are defining the potential usefulness and accuracy of your project with the quality of the data you collect. 

To collect data, you need to identify your sources and aggregate data from those sources into a single dataset. This could mean streaming data from Internet of Things sensors, downloading open source data sets, or constructing a data lake from assorted files, logs, or media. 

Data pre-processing

Once your data is collected, you need to pre-process it. Pre-processing involves cleaning, verifying, and formatting data into a usable dataset. If you are collecting data from a single source, this may be a relatively straightforward process. However, if you are aggregating several sources you need to make sure that data formats match, that data is equally reliable, and remove any potential duplicates. 

Building datasets

This phase involves breaking processed data into three datasets—training, validating, and testing:

Training set—used to initially train the algorithm and teach it how to process information. This set defines model classifications through parameters. 
Validation set—used to estimate the accuracy of the model. This dataset is used to finetune model parameters.
Test set—used to assess the accuracy and performance of the models. This set is meant to expose any issues or mistrainings in the model. 
Training and refinement

Once you have datasets, you are ready to train your model. This involves feeding your training set to your algorithm so that it can learn appropriate parameters and features used in classification. 

Once training is complete, you can then refine the model using your validation dataset. This may involve modifying or discarding variables and includes a process of tweaking model-specific settings (hyperparameters) until an acceptable accuracy level is reached.
